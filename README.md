## Hi! Welcolme to my GitHub üòä 

I have a Bachelor degree in Automation and Computer Engineering obtained at Sapienza University of Rome and a Master degree in Automation and Intelligent Cyber-Physical 
Systems acquired at Politecnico di Torino.

Here is a brief summary of what you can find in my repositories:
- Machine Learning MSc project [‚ÄúData Augmentation techniques for Airbus ship detection‚Äù](https://github.com/enfff/airbus-ship-detection.git), fine-tuning
  of a Faster R-CNN for ship detection starting from aerial images of oceans and seas with a focus on data augmentation techniques to make the model more robust to
  image distortions;
- Reinforcement Learning MSc project [‚ÄúGuided Domain Randomization through Adversarial Agent‚Äù](https://github.com/enfff/rl-hopper.git), Guided Domain Randomization through
  GAN-like approach with an Adversarial agent exploiting the Hopper from Mujoco; 
- [Modeling and Control of Cyber-Physical Systems](https://github.com/enfff/cps-project.git) MSc project, split in a first part of sensors system modeling resilient to
  adversarial attacks and a second part about the control of a set of magnetic levitators described by a certain dynamics exploiting a regulator and an observer from both
  centralized and distributed views;
- System and Device Programming MSc project [OS161](https://github.com/Frirhos-he/os161.git), based on the implementation on a simplistic Operative System like OS161
  of low level functions allowing concurrent execution of programs through processes and threads in order to recreate a Shell;
- [Network Dynamics](https://github.com/lumazzucco/My_university_projects/tree/main/Network%20Dynamics), a series of three homeworks completed during the
  course and focused on modeling agent systems dynamics applying Graph Teory with the help of NetworkX Python library;
- Robot Learning MSc projects, collection of four homeworks committed during the course regarding:
    - [‚ÄúEkf‚Äù](https://github.com/lumazzucco/My_university_projects/tree/main/Robot%20Learning/ekf): implementation of an Extended Kalman Filter applied to a single and double
     pendulum on ROS.
    - [‚ÄúRl-fundamentals‚Äù](https://github.com/lumazzucco/My_university_projects/tree/main/Robot%20Learning/rl-fundamentals): use of Gym Environment used to control the cartpole 
   agent exploiting different reward functions.
    - [‚ÄúQ-learning‚Äù](https://github.com/lumazzucco/My_university_projects/tree/main/Robot%20Learning/qlearning): training cartpole with Q-Learning Temporal Difference algorithm.
    - [‚ÄúPolicy-gradient‚Äù](https://github.com/lumazzucco/My_university_projects/tree/main/Robot%20Learning/policy-gradient): use of Policy Gradient algorithms like PPO and SAC from
    stable-baselines3 library.
- Web Technologies Bachelor project [Cadmus](https://github.com/lumazzucco/My_university_projects/tree/main/Web%20Technologies), creation of a web site dedicated to robotics through
  HTML, CSS, PHP and Javascript.
- Bachelor thesis [‚ÄúContact force control between unstable robot and stiff environment with disturbance rejection‚Äù](https://github.com/lumazzucco/My_university_projects/tree/main/bachelor%20thesis)
